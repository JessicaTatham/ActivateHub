# The "-x-foo-bar" at the end of some locales are "private use subtags";
# they are part of the official BCP 47 ("Tags for Identifying Languages")
# and RFC 4647 ("Matching of Language Tags") specifications for naming
# and matching locales, see the following relevant sections for more info:
#
#   BCP 47 - 2.2.7.  Private Use Subtags
#   http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2.2.7
#
#   BCP 47 - 4.6.  Considerations for Private Use Subtags
#   http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-4.6
#
#   RFC 4647 - 3.4.  Lookup
#   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647#section-3.4
#
# Private use subtags allow us to define a default set of translations for
# a language (ie. "en"), override or complement them on a per-theme basis
# and then further override them on a per-site basis.
#
# **IMPORTANT:** the maximum length of each private use subtag cannot
# exceed eight characters and must contain only letters and numbers
# (see: http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2.1).  While the i18n gem
# does not enforce this by default, you should try to follow this
# convention and remain within the specification.
