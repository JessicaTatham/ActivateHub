ActivateHub is based on the [Calagator](http://calagator.org/) project [source code](http://github.com/calagator/calagator/). We merge frequently to stay close to the Calagator source. Where possible, [bugfixes](http://code.google.com/p/calagator/issues/list) should be sent back upstream, via a [pull request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/). The Calagator [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/pdx-tech-calendar/) is a great resource for communicating upstream.
